posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY, {
  api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com'
});

posthog.capture('$pageview');
```

The above code automatically tracks page views. Add it once, and PostHog will keep tabs on every page load. Pretty handy, right?

### Creating and Tracking Custom Events

For more specific tracking, like button clicks or form submissions, you'll need custom events. Unlike basic pageviews, these events give you insight into user interactions that matter most to you.

Here's a quick way to set up custom event tracking:

1. **Identify the Action:**

   Decide which action you want to track, like a 'Buy Now' button.

2. **Capture the Event:**

   Add event capturing to your components. For example, in a button:

   ```javascript
   const handleClick = () => {
     posthog.capture('buy_now_click', {
       item: 'Super Cool T-shirt',
       price: 20
     });
   };

   <button onClick={handleClick}>Buy Now</button>
   ```

   Here, `buy_now_click` is the custom event name. You can also include additional properties like item and price for more context.

3. **Analyze in PostHog Dashboard:**

   Head over to the PostHog dashboard. You'll see these custom events appearing, ready for analysis, making it easy to spot trends or issues.
